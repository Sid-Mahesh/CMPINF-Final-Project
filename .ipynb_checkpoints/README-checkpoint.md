<h2>The Hoagie Games</h2>
<br>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>For this assignment we chose to answer the question, "What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?" but with an interesting twist. We have assumed the role of the "The Capitol", a totalitarian government that pits every neighborhood against each other in its annual Hoagie Games, a fight to death. Using data from Pittsburgh's WRPDC, we have compiled enough information to determine that if 2 tributes (one male and one female) are chosen randomly from each neighborhood, <a>South Hill Flats</a> would come out victorious and is therefore by association, the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.</p>
